# Machine-Learning-for-Vision-With-Tensorflow

This repository is for Machine Learning for Vision by using Tensorflow in Python.

**Just follow and keep going on-**

#### Who should read this repo-

We will not gonna talk about installation of Tensorflow and not gonna talk about basic of Machine Learning. We will do hands on Tensorflow and see how it's works and find useful function we can use in model building. We assume you must have basic knowledge of Machine Learning and Python.

#### What you will learn-

By the end of this reading you will able to build your own neural networks and have lots of ideas realted to Machine Learning and Tensorflow.

#### Credits-

All codes and credit [https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/).
This repo doesn't include any assignment answers. This repo just have colab notebooks and codes. By reading these documents and codes you will able to build your own neural network and get lots of insight of Machine Learning.

#### How to get started-
**Just start reading following points, this links will redirect you to several pages and colab notebooks. By the end of followning points you will have lots of ideas.**

**Note-** Must read all the links and their respected colab notebooks.
